I'm an Associate Software Engineer with a background in medicine.

I trained at the University of Cambridge before working as a junior doctor in London. Whilst practicing medicine, I discovered my love for programming through various personal projects. After completing the [CodeFirstGirls](https://codefirstgirls.com/) software engineering course, kindly sponsored by Zopa, I transitioned into a career as a Software Engineer.

I'm an advocate of open source development and I'm particularly interested in contributing to open source tools which enhance processes and workflows within medicine and biomedicine. Currently, I'm learning Rust ðŸ¦€ and exploring its capabilities for building reliable, performant software through my open source [contributions](/projects/). I'm part of the [Women in Rust](https://www.meetup.com/women-in-rust/) community, which is a great way to meet other women in the Rust community and learn from each other. In my spare time, I continue to deepen my understanding of computer systems fundamentals to empower me to build more robust and efficient programs. Check out the things I've been learning [here](https://github.com/em-baggie/labs).

If you're interested in my projects or want to discuss a potential collaboration, please [get in touch!](/contact/)
