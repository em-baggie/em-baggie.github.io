I'm a Junior Software Engineer at [Zopa](https://zopa.com), with a background in medicine.

I trained at the University of Cambridge before working as a junior doctor in London. Whilst practicing medicine, I discovered a new passion for programming through various personal projects. After completing the [CodeFirstGirls](https://codefirstgirls.com/) software engineering course, kindly sponsored by Zopa, I transitioned into a career as a software engineer.

I'm an advocate of open source development and I'm particularly interested in contributing to open source tools which enhance processes and workflows within medicine and medical research. Currently, I'm learning Rust ðŸ¦€ and exploring its capabilities for building reliable, performant software through my open source [contributions](/projects/). I'm also deepening my understanding of computer systems fundamentals, through projects like the [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) course, to empower me to build more robust and efficient programs.

If you're interested in my projects or want to discuss a potential collaboration, please [get in touch!](/contact/)
